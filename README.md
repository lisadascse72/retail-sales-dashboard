# 🛍️ Retail Sales Dashboard – IBM Data Analytics Project

This project is part of my IBM Data Analytics coursework. It involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing retail sales data to build an interactive dashboard that helps understand product, region, and time-based sales patterns.

Create a Power BI dashboard using cleaned retail sales data to visualize and filter:
- Monthly sales trends
- Region-wise performance
- Product category insights
